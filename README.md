## BWA-MEM Annotated with Developer Documentation

## Introduction

BWA is the most popular short read aligner in the field of genomics/bioinformatics.

The original source code is written in the highly optimized C code style of the author Heng Li, leveraging many of his own C libraries (klib).

I wanted to understand the library more to the point of being able to port it to rust, and this repo represents my effort to document for my own purposes, and un-abbreviate his code.
